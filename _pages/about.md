I'm an incoming computer science PhD student at Arizona State University working at the intersection of educational technology, human-computer interaction, and applied machine learning. I build and study how human-in-the-loop adaptive learning and tutoring systems, inspectable knowledge representations, and collaboration tools can help diverse learners and educators succeed across K-12, higher education, and workforce training contexts.

Currently, I split my time between the [Construction Workforce and Technology (CWT) Lab](https://www.cwt-lab.com/) led by Dr. Ricardo Eiris in the School of Sustainable Engineering and the Built Environment and the [Sonoran Visualization Lab (SVL)](https://chrisbryan.github.io/) led by Dr. Chris Bryan in the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence.
<!-- Across these collaborations I develop tools that capture engagement signals (emotion, gaze, physiological data) and transform them into actionable learning insights for instructors and students alike. -->

Research Highlights
======
* Investigating gaps in knowledge, skills, and dispositions of students studying computing disciplines through the [Hidden Curricula-Addressing Unseen Challenges within Computer Science Education](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2434430&HistoricalAwards=false) project.
* Modeling learning processes in immersive training environments through the NSF-funded [iVisit: Situated Learning Experiences through Web-based Virtual Field Trips](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2336507&HistoricalAwards=false) project.
* Designing retrieval-augmented question generation pipelines (RASQAL) and AI teaching assistants (SAGE) that support faculty at scale with Teaching Professor [Dr. Yinong Chen](https://search.asu.edu/profile/328180).
* During my undergrad: Co-developed OpenMRT with [Pouya Shaeri](https://pouyashaeri.github.io/), an NSF CAREER project advancing human thermal exposure modeling with street-level imagery under [Dr. Ariane Middel and the SHaDE Lab](https://shadelab.asu.edu/).

<!-- Current Projects
======
* **Jupyter Textbooks** — Extending JupyterLab into an edge-powered interactive textbook platform for active learning.
* **Immersive Training Analytics** — Integrating gaze, posture, and affective signals to deliver richer feedback in virtual reality.
* **Adaptive Curriculum Tools** — Building schema-aware question generators and guided explanation systems that personalize feedback. -->

Teaching & Outreach
======
I’ve supported courses ranging from introductory programming (CSE 110) to upper-division distributed software development (CSE 445), and supervise/mentor student design teams through the [Engineering Projects in Community Service (EPICS)](https://epics.engineering.asu.edu/) program and year-long [CS Capstone](https://sites.google.com/asu.edu/cidse-capstone/home) course.
As an organizer with the [Software Developers Association (./SoDA) at ASU](https://thesoda.io/), I have led planning of local hackathons, workshops, and coding contests and contribute to STEM outreach initiatives like the SCAI [Robotics Camp](https://venus.sod.asu.edu/roboticscamp/) and [Desert CodeSprouts](https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/desert-codesprouts-workshop/).
